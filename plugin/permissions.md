### ðŸ“œ **Explanation**

* **Command Permissions**: Each command has an associated permission controlling who can use it. For example, to allow a player to create BossBars, assign `xbossbar.command.create`. To allow deletion, assign `xbossbar.command.remove`.
* **Global Actions & Caution**: Commands using `*` (all players or all bars) can have server-wide effects. Only grant these permissions to trusted admins.
* **Admin Permission**: The `xbossbar.admin` permission grants full access to all plugin features and commands. This should be reserved for server administrators to prevent unauthorized changes.
